# plotlabserver
Plotlabserver is a tool for distributed, real-time visualization of scientific data. The server manages several OpenGL windows with 2d/3d axes. Clients send data and plot commands via TCP, to be visualized by the server. The server provides options to export graphs as Matlab or Python/matplotlib code.

## Description:
- compile by executing build.sh
- start the server by executing start.sh
- server will create 10 figures as initially hidden windows
- after startup, clients may connect to server and manipulate figures, see plotlablib/README.md for commands

## UI window manipulation:
- keyboard "m" Export Matlab file "plotfile_#date_#time_#figno_#screenshotno.m"
- keyboard "p" Export 2D-Python file "PythonPlotfile_#date_#time_#figno_#screenshotno.py"
- keyboard "o" Export 3D-Python file "PythonPlotfile_#date_#time_#figno_#screenshotno.py"
- keyboard "a" switch between projections: scaled+orthogonal vs. non-scaled+perspective (more useful for 3d)
- keyboard "1,2,3..."" Switch between viewing angles (for 3d)
- keyboard "6" Toggle visibility of axes
- keyboard "7" Toggle grid
- drag left mouse button: rotate viewport
- double click left mouse button: reset view
- mouse wheel: zoom
- +/- zoom with keyboard
- drag right mouse button: translate
